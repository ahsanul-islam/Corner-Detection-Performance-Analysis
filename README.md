# Corner-Detection-Performance-Analysis
It is an attempt of analysing the performance of Shi Tomasi Corner Detection Algorithm 

Here,
minimum quality = The minimum accepted quality of corners represents a fraction of the maximum corner metric value in the image. Larger values can be used to remove erroneous corners.
